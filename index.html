            <h3>Here's a timeline of Virat Kohli's life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>2002</strong> - In October, 13-year-old Virat is called up to the Delhi Under-15 team for
                    the Polly Umrigar Trophy. He finishes the season as Delhi's top scorer.</li>
                <li><strong>2006</strong> - After impressing at the youth level for Delhi, Virat is selected for the
                    India Under-19 team for the first time and has a glorious tour of England, averaging over a hundred
                    in the one-day series.</li>
                <li><strong>2008</strong> - Virat captained India to victory in the Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia,
                    finishing the tournament as one of the top three run-getters. His natural leadership skills caught
                    the attention of all the right people.</li>
                <li><strong>2008(June)</strong> - Still a teenager, Virat is signed by IPL franchise Royal Challengers
                    Bangalore on a youth contract for just Rs 12.5 lakhs.</li>
                <li><strong>2008(August)</strong> - Virat was called up to the Indian ODI squad for the first time,
                    playing all 5 matches in an away series against Sri Lanka. He scored his first half-century, an
                    innings of 54, in game 4 of the series.</li>
                <li><strong>2009</strong> - Virat had to wait a while to get back into the national team, but it was
                    worth it when he scored his maiden ODI century against Sri Lanka, 107 off 111.</li>
                <li><strong>2011</strong> - Virat played every single match of India's successful 2011 World Cup
                    campaign, making his only century in the first game of the tournament against Bangladesh. Though he
                    didn't really light up the tournament with his bat, his quote about Sachin at the end of the
                    tournament has gone down in cricketing folklore: “Sachin Tendulkar has carried the burden of the
                    nation for 21 years. It is time we carried him on our shoulders.”</li>
                <li><strong>2011</strong> - Ask any cricketer what their aspiration is, and they will universally say
                    play Test cricket. Virat finally got the chance to make his Test debut in 2011 against the West
                    Indies, and unfortunately for the charismatic youngster, it was a far-from-memorable occasion,
                    making a grand total of 19 runs in the two innings he played.</li>
                <li><strong>2012</strong> - Kohli scored his first test hundred in rather spectacular circumstances in
                    the fourth and final test against Australia at Adelaide, narrowly surviving getting run out when
                    batting with Ishant Sharma, almost running out of partners as well. His effort though failed to save
                    India. We lost the series 4-0.</li>
                <li><strong>2012</strong> - Virat played what is arguably one of the best ODI innings ever by an Indian
                    batsmen smashing 133 not out against Sri Lanka off just 86 balls to guide India to the final of CB
                    Series in Australia. India were chasing 321 and got to the target in 37 overs as Hobart witnessed
                    one of the greatest batting displays ever.</li>
                <li><strong>2013</strong> - Virat was named stand-in ODI skipper for an injured MS Dhoni when India
                    toured the West Indies; earlier that year, he had also been appointed captain of his IPL franchise,
                    the Royal Challengers Bangalore.</li>
                <li><strong>2014</strong> - Kohli got his first taste of Test captaincy when he was once again asked to
                    step in for an injured MS in Australia, and celebrated by scoring a century in both innings in
                    Adelaide.</li>
                <li><strong>2015</strong> - Having become a co-owner in ISL football club FC Goa the previous year,
                    Kohli extended his interest to tennis by also picking up stake in the IPTL franchise, UAE Royals.
                </li>
                <li><strong>2016</strong> - He played what was easily the best innings of his burgeoning career as India
                    beat Australia in Mohali to advance to the semi-finals of the ICC World T20. His 82 off 51 balls was
                    a classy effort, etched with timing and precision as opposed to the lappa style of cricket one
                    usually associates with 20 over cricket.</li>
                <li><strong>2017(January)</strong> - Virat is appointed as India's full-time captain in all three
                    formats after MS Dhoni steps down from limited-overs captaincy.</li>
                <li><strong>2017(June)</strong> - Kohli leads India to the ICC Champions Trophy final in England.
                    Although India loses to Pakistan in the final, Kohli's captaincy garners widespread praise.</li>
                <li><strong>2017(December)</strong> - Kohli marries Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma in a private
                    ceremony in Italy.</li>
                <li><strong>2018(August)</strong> - Kohli has a stellar tour of England, scoring 593 runs across five
                    Tests, silencing critics who questioned his performance in English conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>2018(October)</strong> - Kohli becomes the fastest player to reach 10,000 ODI runs,
                    achieving the feat in just 205 innings, surpassing the record held by Sachin Tendulkar.</li>
                <li><strong>2018(November)</strong> - Kohli finishes the year as the No. 1-ranked batsman in both Tests
                    and ODIs, showcasing his dominance across formats.</li>
                <li><strong>2019(March)</strong> - Kohli becomes the first player in history to win ICC's Cricketer of
                    the Year, ICC Test Player of the Year, and ICC ODI Player of the Year awards in a single year.</li>
                <li><strong>2019(July)</strong> - Kohli leads India to the semi-finals of the ICC Cricket World Cup,
                    where they lose to New Zealand.</li>
                <li><strong>2019(October)</strong> - Kohli scores his highest individual score in Tests, an unbeaten 254
                    against South Africa in Pune.</li>
                <li><strong>2021(January)</strong> - Kohli and Anushka have their first child, Vamika.</li>
                <li><strong>2021(November)</strong> - India fails to reach the semi-finals of the ICC T20 World Cup in
                    UAE, and Kohli steps down as T20I captain.</li>
                <li><strong>2021(December)</strong> - Kohli is removed as ODI captain by the BCCI, with Rohit Sharma
                    named as his successor.</li>
                <li><strong>2022(January)</strong> - Kohli resigns from Test captaincy after India loses the Test series
                    in South Africa. His resignation marks the end of a seven-year stint as Test captain, making him
                    India's most successful Test captain with 40 wins.</li>
                <li><strong>2022(September)</strong> - Kohli scores his much-anticipated 71st international century
                    against Afghanistan in the Asia Cup, marking his first T20I hundred and ending a nearly
                    three-year-long wait for a century.</li>
                <li><strong>2022(October)</strong> - Kohli plays a memorable knock of 82 not out against Pakistan in the
                    T20 World Cup in Australia, leading India to a thrilling last-ball victory.</li>
                <li><strong>2023(September)</strong> - Kohli plays a key role for India in the Asia Cup, scoring a
                    century against Pakistan in the Super 4 stage and contributing to India's title victory.</li>
                <li><strong>2023(October-November)</strong> - Kohli represents India in the ICC Cricket World Cup hosted
                    in India. During the group stage, Kohli reached a major milestone by surpassing Sachin Tendulkar's
                    record for most centuries in ODI cricket, achieving his 50th ODI hundred in a memorable innings that
                    was celebrated worldwide. Kohli scored three centuries, including one in the semi-finals against New
                    Zealand. Kohli scored six fifties, including one in the final. Kohli's performance helped India
                    stamp their authority in the quadrennial event, but they were unable to lift the trophy. Kohli
